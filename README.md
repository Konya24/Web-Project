# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone project is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Users can list properties, search for places to stay, make bookings, and leave reviews.

### Project Goals
- Understand full-stack web development concepts
- Implement secure RESTful APIs
- Practice team collaboration with version control
- Gain experience with database modeling and backend architecture

---

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Designs and develops server-side logic and APIs to handle business logic and database interaction.
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds the user interface and ensures a seamless user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs, maintains, and optimizes the database schema and queries for efficiency and scalability.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages the CI/CD pipeline, automates deployments, and ensures reliable infrastructure.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees progress, assigns tasks, and ensures the team meets deadlines and milestones.
- **QA Engineer**: Writes and performs tests to ensure the application is free of bugs and meets quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs quickly and securely.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database to store structured project data such as users, bookings, and properties.
- **GraphQL** (optional): An alternative to REST for querying APIs with precise and efficient data fetching.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for creating responsive and interactive frontend interfaces.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building reusable UI components and managing client-side state.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used to standardize the development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub to automate tests, builds, and deployments.

## Database Design

### Entities and Key Fields

- **User**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - A user can be a host or guest. A user can have many bookings and listings.

- **Listing (Property)**
  - `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`
  - Each listing belongs to one host (user) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

- **Booking**
  - `id`, `listing_id`, `guest_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`
  - A booking links a guest to a listing over a specific period.

- **Review**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `listing_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Users can leave reviews on listings they booked.

- **Payment**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
  - Stores payment-related data for each booking.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts and guests have different access levels.

- **Property Management**
  - Hosts can list, update, and delete properties. Listings include images, pricing, and descriptions.

- **Booking System**
  - Guests can search, view availability, and book listings. The system manages conflicts and total cost calculations.

- **Review System**
  - Users can leave ratings and feedback on listings they stayed in, promoting trust within the platform.

- **Payment Integration**
  - Bookings include secure payment processing using services like Stripe or PayPal (mock or real).

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Ensures that only registered users can access protected routes (via tokens or sessions).
- **Authorization**: Restricts actions (e.g., only hosts can edit their own listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and brute-force attacks by limiting API requests per IP/user.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against injection attacks and malformed input.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures encrypted data transmission between clients and server.

Security is crucial to protect user data, enable secure transactions, and maintain trust in the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **CI/CD Overview**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code.
- **Why Itâ€™s Important**:
  - Reduces human error
  - Speeds up deployment
  - Ensures code is tested before it goes live
- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Runs tests automatically on each commit and pull request.
  - **Docker**: Packages the app into containers for consistent deployments.
  - **Heroku / AWS / Netlify**: Deployment platforms for staging or production environments.
